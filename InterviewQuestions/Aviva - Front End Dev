Key notes:
I assume they will ask questions about TDD and BDD but because I already talked about it, they may have just skipped asking me altogether.
Nothing about CSS, HTML, PHP, XML, SQL.
Didn't mention requesting code samples (I forgot to give it to them).
Nothing about continuous integration, SDLC.
No questions related to or about AVIVA.


They told me these skills were very important in their company and that it would be necessary to learn these skills in order to be a front end developer.
